# Smart Healthcare Data Engineering Pipeline (PySpark)

A complete **Healthcare Analytics Data Engineering Pipeline** built using **PySpark** and the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

This project processes raw hospital patient visit records from CSV, cleans and transforms them into Parquet format, models the data into a Star Schema, and generates key healthcare business insights through Spark analytics queries.

It is designed as a **portfolio-quality Data Engineering project** demonstrating real-world ETL workflows, scalable data lake design, and analytics-ready outputs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Healthcare organizations generate large volumes of patient visit data every day.  
To support reporting, analytics, and decision-making, raw transactional records must be transformed into clean, structured datasets.

This pipeline performs:

- Raw data ingestion into a Data Lake (Bronze)
- Data cleaning and enrichment (Silver)
- Star Schema modeling for analytics (Gold)
- KPI queries for hospital insights
